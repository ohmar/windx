Using Xephyr

Xephyr is a neat program that usually comes bundled with an X installation.
It is not required but it makes testing a window manager a lot easier.

Start it with Xephyr :N -screen widthxheight (N being the display you want to start it at.)
	  Ex. Xephyr :1 -screen 1024x768

To start windx, open a new terminal and pass the display number to it when running it
	  Ex. DISPLAY=:1 python2 /location/of/file/windx.py

Playing with windx

As stated in windx.py; Shift-Enter opens an instance of URxvt.
Move the window around by right clicking and dragging.
